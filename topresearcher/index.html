		<h1>TopResearcher</h1>
	
		<p>
			Have you ever wondering who has the most papers published in a certain conference (or journal)?
			TopResearcher is designed to answer this question, which maintains a full list of papers as well as an author rank for a certain conference.
			All the results are built through the DBLP's resources.
			<br />
			Note that all the results in this project are automatically conducted through a tool, called TopResearcher, 
			which is currently available as an open source project at <a href="">here</a>.
