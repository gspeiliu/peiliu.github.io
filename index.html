			  I joined <a href="https://www.monash.edu">Monash University</a> as a Lecturer on February 2018. 
			  Prior to that, I was a research associate in Software Engineering at the 
			  <a href="https://wwwen.uni.lu">University of Luxembourg (UL)</a> and an honorary research associate working with 
			  <a href="http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/M.Harman/">Prof. Mark Harman</a> at CREST/SSE, 
			  <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk">University College London (UCL)</a>.
				
				<br />
			  
			  I obtained my Phd degree in November 2016 from the 
			  <a href="http://www.securityandtrust.lu">Interdisciplinary Security and Trust Centre (SnT)</a>, 
			  <a href="">University of Luxembourg (UL)</a>, under the supervision of 
			  <a href="http://wwwen.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon">Prof. Yves Le Traon</a> and
			  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jacqueskleinwebpage/">Dr. Jacques Klein</a>.
			  
			  My research interests are in the areas of Android Security, Static Analysis, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Empirical Study.
